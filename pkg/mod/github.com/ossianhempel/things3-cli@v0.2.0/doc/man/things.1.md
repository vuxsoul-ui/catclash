Update operations use the Things URL scheme and require an auth token.

the Things URL scheme authorization token.

## things add [OPTIONS] [--] [-|TITLE]

Adds new todos to Things.

If `-` is given as a title, it is read from STDIN. When titles have multiple
lines of text, the first is set as the todo's title and the remaining lines
are set as the todo's notes. Notes set this way take precedence over the
`--notes=` option.

Repeating todos are created via the Things database and require a single
explicit title (no `--titles`, `--use-clipboard`, or quick entry).

**OPTIONS**

  Path to the Things database. Overrides the THINGSDB environment variable.
  Used for repeat operations.

*--canceled*, *--cancelled*

  to create additional checklist items (maximum of 100).

  todo in the database. Ignored if the todo is not completed or canceled,
  or if the date is in the future.

  multiple todos have been created, the first one will be shown. Ignored
  if show-quick-entry is also set to true. Default: false.

  apply a tag if the specified tag doesn't exist.

  and show-quick-entry. The other parameters are applied to all the
  created todos.

*--use-clipboard=VALUE*
  Possible values can be replace-title (newlines overflow into notes,
  replacing them), replace-notes, or replace-checklist-items (newlines
